# Section 4 802.11 MAC Architecture

## Review Questions


Now that you have been bombarded by wireless terms and definitions, review the following or answer the following.

1. In which 802.11 frame type would an analyst find layer 3 and higher data?

2. The maximum transmission unit (MTU) for 802.11 wireless networks is different from 802.3/Ethernet. In fact, it is larger. How does an access point handle the MTU differences?
j
3. With which amendment(s) would an analyst see aggregated data frames, those exceeding the original MTU for wireless networks?

4. In which layers of the OSI model would an analyst see a MAC Layer Protocol Data Unit (MPDU) and Physical Layer Service Data Unit (PSDU)?
j
5. Beacon frames originate from which type of device or station?

6. What 802.11 network device assumes the role of a portal? What is the role of the portal?

7. In a wireless network that employs encryption, which frame type(s) is/are encrypted and in, which parts of the frame(s).

8. State four types of information that can be seen inside of a Beacon frame.

9. Why do clients listen to and probe for other networks despite being currently associated with an access point?

10. Open System Authentication implemented in the most secure wireless networks. How is this possible or why does this make sense?

11. After a client forms a Layer 2 connection with an access point, the client receives an Association ID (AID). What is the purpose of an AID?

12. What is the name of the protection mechanism used in networks that support both 802.11b and 802.11g clients?

13. 802.11n networks that only support other 802.11n devices are considered to be what mode of operation?

14. How do client stations inform their access point that they are running on battery and will sleep to conserve its power?

15. Each data frame sent to a client should be followed up by which type of response?

## Step 9: Start a Terminal in the Parrott VM

Most of your work should be done using the Linux terminal, so you should start a terminal. Please
note this terminal should be started *inside* the VM, and not in the Ubuntu VM that is hosting
Virtualbox. 

There is a button at the top of the Parrot VM which has a `_>` character, as indicated in the
following picture. Please press this button and a terminal will appear as shown.

## Step 10: Clone this Github in the VM

It will be helpful to clone this github in the VM, so you can refer to the labs here.


```
git clone https://www.github.com/timfox456/wireless2-labs
```

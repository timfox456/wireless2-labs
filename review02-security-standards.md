# Section 2 Security Standards and Overview

Another short review to reinforce key concepts and terms that you will see
throughout wireless technologies and topics. Explain or answer the following.



1. How would you summarize the role of the Wi-Fi Alliance when it comes to
   802.11 technologies?


2. Regarding the OSI model, where do 802.11 communications take place? In which
   major layers? What are the names of the sublayers?



3. The FCC is a regulatory domain authority. What are four characteristics of
   802.11 wireless communications in which the FCC regulates?



4. What are the frequency bands in which unlicensed 802.11 communications
   operate?



5. 802.11g devices can be backwards compatible with which other 802.11 devices?



6. With the ratification of the 802.11i amendment, wireless network security
   was enhanced in three major areas. What are those areas and how did the
   amendment define each?



7. Robust Management Frame protections are meant to address what 802.11
   security shortfalls? How well does the amendment address Layer 1 issues?



8. In 2009, the 802.11n amendment was ratified. Devices that are 802.11n
   certified can operate in what frequency bands?



9. Are 802.11n devices that operate in 2.4 GHz channels compatible with the
   newer 802.11ac devices and access points? Why or why not?



10. Regarding the concept of Core, Distribution and Access, where are you most
    likely to find wireless bridges?



11. Regarding 802.11ax, what is the advantage over 802.11ac OFDM?
